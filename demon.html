    <p id ="w">Digital works I made for the Demon Slayer anime. I drew four main characters, consisting of character drawings in semi-realistic style. I applied acrylic paint on the hexagonal Canvas. You can also watch the video here. A sketch of the project. Applying the artworks on the HEGXIE by hand painting or print is available for SALE.Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He has become his family's sole source of income after the passing of his father, making trips to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changes when he comes home one day to discover that his family has been attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko are the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by him and sent to be taught by Sakonji Urokodaki, another member of the Demon Slayer Corps, to also become a demon slayer, and begins his quest to help his sister turn human again and avenge the deaths of the rest of his family…</p>
